This project provides a dashboard for better shopping planning during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Users can see visitation counts for the whole 2 weeks of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, analyze hourly variations in traffic for each store and brand, and filter data based on discounts offered by stores. The data was normalized for weather conditions to provide accurate insights.
